    <h1>What is the Gyro</h1>

    <p>
        Gyros, 
        sometimes anglicized as a gyro in some regions,
         is meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie,
        then sliced and served wrapped or stuffed in pita bread,
        along with other ingredients such as tomato,
        onion, fried potatoes, 
        and tzatziki sauce.

    c<h1>How did the Gyro come to be</h1>
    
    <p>
        
            Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat and slicing it off as it cooks was developed in bursa in the 19th century in the Ottoman Empire.
             After the 1922-23 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, 
             the Greeks brought their variation with them to Greece. Following World War II,
              gyros made with lamb was present in Athens. It was likely introduced by immigrants from Anatolia 
              and the Middle East.
             The Greek version is normally made with pork and served with tzatziki, and became known as gyros.
