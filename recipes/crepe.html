    <h1>What is the Crepe?</h1>

    <p>A crêpe or crepe is a dish made from unleavened batter or dough that is cooked on a frying pan or 
        a griddle. 
        Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: 
        sweet crêpes or savoury galettes. 
        They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of 
        spreads.</p>

    <p>The history of crêpes dates back to 13th century Brittany, France. 
        It seems a housewife there accidentally dribbled some thin porridge onto a hot,
         flat cooktop. Since people back then weren't inclined to waste even the smallest cooking mistakes, she ate it, the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

        <h1>How to make the Crepe</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, blend milk, eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour 15 to 20 seconds, or until batter is smooth. You could also whisk in a bowl. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat an 8-inch frying pan over medium-low heat. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into the pan, tilting pan immediately from side to side to form an even circle. Cook about 1 minute per side, or until lightly browned. Remove from heat and stack until ready to serve. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite toppings. Fresh fruit, jams, pudding, nutella, whipped topping and nuts are a few of our favorites.</li>
        </ol>
