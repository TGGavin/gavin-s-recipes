    <p>A crêpe or crepe is a dish made from unleavened batter or dough that is cooked on a frying pan or 
        a griddle. 
        Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: 
        sweet crêpes or savoury galettes. 
        They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of 
        spreads.</p>

    <p>The history of crêpes dates back to 13th century Brittany, France. 
        It seems a housewife there accidentally dribbled some thin porridge onto a hot,
         flat cooktop. Since people back then weren't inclined to waste even the smallest cooking mistakes, she ate it, the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
