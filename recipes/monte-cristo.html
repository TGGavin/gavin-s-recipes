    A <strong>Monte Cristo</strong> sandwich is an egg-dipped or batter-dipped ham and cheese 
    sandwich that is pan or deep fried. It is a variation of the French croque monsieur.
    Depending on the regional variation, the sandwich can either be savory or a mixture of <em>savory and sweet</em>. In its most basic form, it is dipped in beaten egg and pan-fried, though it may also be deep-fried in beer or pancake batter. Regional variations may include sliced turkey or caramelized onions. Some variants are served grilled; in other variations, the Monte Cristo is served as an open sandwich, with only the bread egg-dipped and pan fried. In such cases, the fully assembled sandwich is then usually heated slightly under a grill or broiler. In sweeter variations, the Monte Cristo is often covered in powdered <e>sugar</e> and served with maple syrup or preserves.

    <p><h1>History of The Monte Cristo</h1>
    The first documented reference to a "Monte Cristo Sandwich" was in an American restaurant industry publication in 1923.
     From the 1930s to the 1960s, American cookbooks commonly had recipes for similar croque monsieur variants, 
     under such names as "French sandwich", "toasted ham sandwich", and "French toasted cheese sandwich". 
     Though it is commonly claimed that the Monte Cristo sandwich was developed in the 1960s in Southern California,
      mentions of the sandwich by name in earlier decades and similar recipes appearing in cookbooks cast doubt on this claim. 
      Nevertheless, the sandwich developed a larger popularity in the region, 
      and it rose in popularity nationally after the Blue Bayou Restaurant in Disneyland began to serve the sandwich.
       The sandwich is heavily associated with the Bennigan's restaurant chain.
