    A Monte Cristo sandwich is an egg-dipped or batter-dipped ham and cheese 
    sandwich that is pan or deep fried. It is a variation of the French croque monsieur.

    <p><h1>Orgin of The Monte Cristo</h1>
    The first documented reference to a "Monte Cristo Sandwich" was in an American restaurant industry publication in 1923.
     From the 1930s to the 1960s, American cookbooks commonly had recipes for similar croque monsieur variants, 
     under such names as "French sandwich", "toasted ham sandwich", and "French toasted cheese sandwich". 
     Though it is commonly claimed that the Monte Cristo sandwich was developed in the 1960s in Southern California,
      mentions of the sandwich by name in earlier decades and similar recipes appearing in cookbooks cast doubt on this claim. 
      Nevertheless, the sandwich developed a larger popularity in the region, 
      and it rose in popularity nationally after the Blue Bayou Restaurant in Disneyland began to serve the sandwich.
       The sandwich is heavily associated with the Bennigan's restaurant chain.
