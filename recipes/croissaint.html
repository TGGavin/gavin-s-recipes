    <h1>What is the Crossaint</h1>
    <img src="../img/croissaint-h-one.jpg" alt="" width="650">

    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
         It is a buttery, flaky, 
         viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl,
          but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. 
          Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.</p>

    <h1>How did the Crossaint come to be</h1>

    <h2>The Croissaint pre-cursor, the "Kifli" </h2>

    <p>Enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kifli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Kipferl</a> an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, 
        can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, 
        and came in various shapes. The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings.
        In either 1838 or 1839, an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, 
        rue de Richelieu in Paris. 
        This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, 
        quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie,
         a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). 
         The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent 
         (croissant) shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.</p>

    <h2>The Croissaint appears</h2>

        <p>
        The earliest known recipe for the present-day croissant appears in 1905,
         although the name croissant appears among the "fantasy or luxury breads" in 1853.
         Earlier recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century
          and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.
          By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple,
          The puff pastry technique that now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th century, 
          when La Varenne's Le Cuisinier françois gave a recipe for it in the 1680  and possibly earlier  edition. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent).
           It does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the croissant until the 20th century.
          The first recipe corresponding to the modern croissant, not only for the shape but also the texture of the dough and the taste, was published in 1906, in Paris, in Colombié's Nouvelle Encyclopédie culinaire.
